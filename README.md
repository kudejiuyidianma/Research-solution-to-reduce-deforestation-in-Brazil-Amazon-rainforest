Due to the increase in deforestation rates, the world's climate, food production, public health and other aspects have been severely affected. Because the governments of the region do not do the thing to improve deforestation, the Amazons indigenous and the region's poorest residents can use reasonable resources to fight for their own vitality on the premise of not destroying the sustainable development of the rainforest, while defending their homes. International organizations and countries should provide support for them.  Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is the most serious long-term global problem in climate change. With the reduction of forest coverage, the loss of biodiversity, the increase of greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, reduction of rainfall, and extreme weather such as severe droughts occur frequently. The Amazon Rainforest Sustainable Development Project is a solution to this problem. With the joint efforts of Amazon countries and the world, the chocolate made with Amazonâ€™s natural cocoa has promoted the living standards of people in the Amazon region to reduce illegal deforestation.
